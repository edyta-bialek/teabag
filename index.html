				<h3>White</h3>
				<IMG SRC="img/6.jpg" class="img-fluid images-shadow" alt="White">
				<p>Some sources use the term to refer to tea that is merely dried with no additional processing, some to tea made from the buds and immature tea leaves allowed to wither and dry in natural sun. Most definitions agree, however, that white tea is not rolled or oxidized, resulting in a flavour characterized as "lighter" than most green or traditional black teas. </p>

				<h3>Yellow</h3>
				<IMG SRC="img/7.jpg"  class="img-fluid images-shadow"  alt="portfolio smooth smoothies">
				<p>Unwilted and unoxidized but allowed to yellow;
				Yellow tea is often placed in the same category with green tea due to its light oxidation. One of the primary aims of making yellow tea is to remove the characteristic grassy smell of green tea while preserving the associated health qualities of green tea. </p>

				<IMG SRC="img/5.jpg" class="img-fluid images-shadow"  alt="portfolio powerpoint">
				<p>Type of tea that is made from leaves that have not undergone the same withering and oxidation process used to make oolong teas and black teas.

				<IMG SRC="img/2.jpg" class="img-fluid images-shadow"   alt="portfolio fintech website">
				<p> Oolong tea is a traditional semi-oxidized Chinese tea produced through a process including withering the plant under strong sun and oxidation before curling and twisting. Most oolong teas, especially those of fine quality, involve unique tea plant cultivars that are exclusively used for particular varieties. Unlike green tea, seeming to improve with reuse. </p>

				<p>Wilted, sometimes crushed, and fully oxidized (called "red tea" in Chinese tea culture);
					Popular varieties of black tea include Assam, Nepal, Darjeeling, Nilgiri, Rize, Keemun, and Ceylon teas.
					Black tea is generally stronger in flavour than the less oxidized teas. All four types are made from leaves of the shrub (or small tree) Camellia sinensis.</p>

				<p>Pu-erh green or red Pu-erh tea is a variety of fermented tea produced in Yunnan province, China. The town of Pu'er is named after the tea that is produced close by. Fermentation in the context of tea production involves microbial fermentation and oxidation of the tea leaves, after they have been dried and rolled. This process is a Chinese specialty and produces tea known as heich√° (black or dark tea).</p>

			<p class="history1"><b>The History of Tea</b></p>

			<p class="history">Tea drinking in China has its earliest references in connection to the mythical emperor Shennong, who is regarded as the father of Chinese medicine and agriculture. Shennnong is said to have tasted hundreds of wild herbs, including tea leaves, to ascertain their medicinal value. According to this legend, the discovery of tea dates back to around 2700 B.C., the era in which Shennong is said to have lived.
			During the late Western Han dynasty (1st century B.C.), The Divine Farmer's Herb-Root Classic, a book attributed to Shennong, includes a reference about tea. This suggests that even at this early point in history much knowledge about tea had already been accumulated. In 59 B.C., Wang Bao, of Sichuan Province, wrote the first known book providing instructions on buying and preparing tea - entitled A Contract with a Servant - establishing that tea was not only an important part of diet but that it was a commonly traded commodity at this time. This book is said to be the first written reference to tea utensils. At the time, tea drinking was still a luxury enjoyed by the elite classes of Chinese society.
			During the Tang dynasty (around 760), writer Lu Yu wrote Cha Jing (The Classic of Tea), an early work on the subject. The book's opening passage is about tea's origins in the south, showing that this has been a long-held theory.</p>

					<h3>Is the glass enough? Tea Equipment</h3>
					<p>In many regions of the world, however, actively boiling water is used and the tea is often stewed.</p>
					<p>Each type of preparation needs own equpments and accessories. We can find teapots, special kettles, glasses, infusers, whisks and other.</p>
					<p>Samovar is a heated metal container traditionally used to heat and boil water in Russia. Additionally, the samovar is well known outside of Russia and spread through the Russian culture to Eastern Europe, South-Eastern Europe, Iran, Afghanistan, Kashmir, the Middle East, Vietnam, and is meanwhile also known in some parts of Central Europe. Since the heated water is typically used to make tea, many samovars have a ring-shaped attachment (Russian: –∫–æ–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–∫–∞, konforka) around the chimney to hold and heat a teapot filled with tea concentrate.</p>
